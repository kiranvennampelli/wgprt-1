Here are the test cases in BDD format for the XSD structure:

**paymentInfo element**

* **paymentInfo exists**
	Given a paymentInfo element
	When the element is validated
	Then the element is present
* **paymentInfo has exactly one occurrence**
	Given a paymentInfo element
	When the element is validated
	Then the element occurs exactly once
* **paymentInfo has cardType child**
	Given a paymentInfo element
	When the element is validated
	Then the element has a cardType child
* **paymentInfo has transInfo child**
	Given a paymentInfo element
	When the element is validated
	Then the element has a transInfo child

**cardType child**

* **cardType exists**
	Given a paymentInfo element with a cardType child
	When the element is validated
	Then the cardType child is present
* **cardType has exactly one occurrence**
	Given a paymentInfo element with a cardType child
	When the element is validated
	Then the cardType child occurs exactly once
* **cardType has valid CreditDebitCode type**
	Given a paymentInfo element with a cardType child
	When the element is validated
	Then the cardType child has a valid CreditDebitCode type

**transInfo child**

* **transInfo exists**
	Given a paymentInfo element with a transInfo child
	When the element is validated
	Then the transInfo child is present
* **transInfo has optional occurrence**
	Given a paymentInfo element with a transInfo child
	When the element is validated
	Then the transInfo child occurs at most once
* **transInfo has valid Max34Text type**
	Given a paymentInfo element with a transInfo child
	When the element is validated
	Then the transInfo child has a valid Max34Text type with a minimum length of 1 and a maximum length of 34

Note that these test cases are not exhaustive, and you may want to add more test cases to ensure the XSD is properly validated.
